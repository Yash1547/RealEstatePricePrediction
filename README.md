## RealEstatePricePrediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting real estate prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained on a dataset obtained from a real estate agency, and it is deployed as a web application using Flask framework. Users can input property details, and the model will provide an estimated price based on the input.
